# This is a cashback service for cryptotraders

The project is based on the binance's feature of referral incomes .csv unloading

You see, the most popular crypto exchange (binance) has very weak api, 
that doesn't allow you to do as many cool things as their private api does.\
Even tho you can access private api features through the web interface. 

This is why we need to write our own projects that basically half-automate instead of fully automating certaing things.

## What's this project about? 

Binance has a referral program for regular users, 
that becomes the same power or even more powerfull than binance's brocker program with certain VIP level's.

Apart from that, this approach allows users to store their money on their own exchange accounts, and not transfer 
money to no brocker, as well as not to show any of your trades (which is a big point for a lot of successful traders).

## Current achievements

At this moment, this project helped to save more than 50000$ worth of commissions that could have earned binance.

It's a big deal to many traders, because this project essentialy saves them 25-30% of comission for nothing.

And for many it's a difference between losing and earning money from the cryptomarket. 

#### Technical points

Basically this project can be scaled to as many white-label cashback services as nessesary. \
They can be branded differently, but have a one owner. 

In-bot support option allows to store all support dialogues forever

The system can support .csv's up to 200 megabytes right not, but it can be easily improved \
to optimally no cap with changes of data upload to the db 
(right now it stores full .csv file in memory for the convenience of data validation)
